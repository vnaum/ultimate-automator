this ultimate automator will automate any of your daily tasks.

and it's hightly configurable:
just describe steps you want to perform in
`~/.config/ultimate-automator/steps/1.sh` (`2.sh`, `3.sh`)

This early version only supports 3 steps,
but enterprise version I'm working on now will support up to 10.
